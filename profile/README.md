### [Why?](https://github.com/the-antibody)
It's not just the fact that unfortunately there are many people on the internet who are "out to get you" that upsets me. It's not even the fact that some of them develop malware and use it to infect other people without their permission, giving legitimate malware analysts & developers a bad name that upsets me. But the fact that the public still sees it as "okay" to promote operating systems and pieces of software that are closed-source (meaning you can't view the code), **despite** the very obvious reality that closed-source software is infinitely more dangeorous and more likely to infringe upon your privacy. I support GNU's wanting to make everything free, and by extension open source, but the reason I support this is not because of the money, but because of the rights the user is supposed to have.
